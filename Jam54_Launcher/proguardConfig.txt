  # Dont obfuscate the names of these classes. Most of the styling is done using style classes. However, sometimes we directly style a component using its classname. In those cases the components would no longer have their style applied, since the obfuscation process renames class names. Therefore don't obfuscate the names of these classes, but do obfuscate the content of them since that shouldn't break anything.
