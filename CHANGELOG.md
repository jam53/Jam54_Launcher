- Fix a bug where when an application with an update was opened; opened as in on the `ApplicationWindow`. After which another application with an update on the `AvailableAppUpdatesWindow` was started, the initial app from the `ApplicationWindow` would start to update, rather than the app that was selected to update on the `AvailableAppUpdatesWindow` ([`4917aa1`](https://github.com/jam53/Jam54_Launcher/commit/4917aa1ca99e4f049dac0c09843595dfc9915f6e))

- Refactor the way shortcuts are created. Rather than making a shortcut to a specific application's executable, a shortcut is created to the Jam54 Launcher with the application id as a CLI argument. This way the shortcuts will still work to launch applications, even after the installation location was changed after a shortcut was created ([`66fccce`](https://github.com/jam53/Jam54_Launcher/commit/66fccce194df52f48b643f3d23485458551c19b2))

## [3.2.7] - 2024-02-17
### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where the Jam54Launcher window would "overflow" the user's screen. This was caused by the scaling in Windows settings being set very high ([`a90b737`](https://github.com/jam53/Jam54_Launcher/commit/a90b737877a18721d0607d0f239a9bb244a7a3dd))
