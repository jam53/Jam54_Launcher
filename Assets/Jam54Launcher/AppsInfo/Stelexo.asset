  description: "Stelexo is a free to play single player sandbox game. Featuring a
    completely randomly generated world, which includes rocks, trees, animals, enemies
    and much more! A world full of secrets and adventures awaits you!  \u200B  The
    development of Stelexo started primarily in July of 2018 and was the first major
    game I worked on.   The plan was to create a world that was procedurally generated,
    augmented with creatures, objects and more.  I realised that this project's scope
    was way behond what I could do on my own. So after a final update in December
    2020, the development of Stelexo ended."
