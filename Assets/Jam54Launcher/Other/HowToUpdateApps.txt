Open the HashesCreator visual studio project

In the solutions explorer > rightclick > publish > hit Publish at the top

now go to HashesCreator\bin\Publish

Delete the .pdb file
Copy the HashesCreator.exe


Go to jamhorn's github

Create a new repo called, Apps

(if the builds of certain apps didn't change, just copy their zip's frm OneDrive\Documenten\Scripts\Jam54Launcher\AppBuildZips
Take the latest build of Stelexo (OneDrive\Documenten\Scripts\Unity\Builds\Stelexo\Stelexo0.3.0)
Copy all the files to an empty directory called 'Stelexo'
Also Copy the HashesCreator.exe in there and run it
When it's finished, delete the HashesCreator.exe executable
Zip the Stelexo folder, when it's zipped, delete the Stelexo folder

Do this for all the remaining apps

Go to the repo called 'Apps' > Create a new release

Tag & title don't really matter, but to be consisten just use the Jam54Launcher's version number.
It doesn't matter because always take the latest release, not a specific release

After you made the new release, do at least one commit so it updates



Add/Update version number in remote config
