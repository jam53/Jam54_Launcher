    m_Localized: "Stelexo is a free to play single player game. Featuring a completely
      randomly generated world, which includes rocks, trees, animals, enemies and
      much more! A world full of secrets and adventures awaits you! \r\n\r\nThe development
      of Stelexo started primarily in July of 2018 and was the first game I worked
      on.\r\n\r\nThe plan was to create a world that was procedurally generated,
      augmented with creatures, objects and more.  I realised that this project's
      scope was way behond what I could do on my own. So after a final update in
      January 2021, the development of Stelexo ended."
