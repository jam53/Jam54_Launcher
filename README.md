# Jam54_Launcher
The Jam54 Launcher is used to install and update all of the software developed by jam54. The launcher itself is written in Java and JavaFX.

## Functionality
The launcher updates automatically to the latest version available. No user interaction is required.

The programs/games available within the launcher can either be updated manually or automatically. For this a custom build solution has been developed that makes use of delta updates. This only requires the user to download new files or the files that have been changed, not the whole application. This saves significantly on time and bandwidth.

Furthermore, the launcher can be used in a variety of languages and the user can choose a specific install location.

## Downloading the launcher
You can download the launcher from [here](https://jam53.github.io/jam54/download.html).

## Development of the Jam54 Launcher
The main reason behind the development of the launcher, was to create one unified place for people to download all the games/programs that have been developed by jam54. Instead of having to search for download links that are scattered all over the [official website.](https://jam53.github.io/jam54)

If you want to know more about how the launcher works. Or are curious as to why and how certain things were implemented you can read more in [General overview of the Jam54 Launcher.](./Documentation/GeneralOverviewOfTheJam54Laucher.md)
